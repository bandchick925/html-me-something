        <p>
            Pick up an instrument like clarinet because you happen to have one around the house and your middle school band director thinks you aren't aggressive enough to play the saxophone. (Be passive aggessive about that last part for about a decade or so.

            Who cares if you keep hearing that French Horn is difficult? If it gets you away from those dramatic clarinet, just pick it up. You have a tuner, a french horn book, and the internet...make it happen.

            Collect band scholarship money for something that you used to do for free. Experiment with other instruments. Take pictures with random sousaphones for social media. Join a band fraternity. Be entrusted with the responsibility of waving your hands in the air and having other band members follow you.

            Take your talents to "South Beach" and collect more band money. Get handed a sousaphone when everyone is aware that you've never seriously played this instrument in your life. Figure it out. Enjoy the band trips and food that you don't have to pay for.

            My apologies if this wasn't what you were expecting. However, I hope you enjoyed the super condensed version of my band life.
